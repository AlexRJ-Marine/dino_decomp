# NOW — Dino Island

Updated: 2026-10-28

This is the injected dashboard. Keep it under ~80 lines. Full history and
evidence live in `notes/STATE.md` (read on demand); open tasks are in
`notes/OPEN-TASKS.md` (regenerate with `scripts/tasks.ps1 -Update`).

## Rules (short)

- Never write `original/` or `game/`; never copy retail assets into `src/`.
- Every format/gameplay claim needs evidence: hex dump, decompiled function,
  trace, or a parser/test against a real sample. Note first, doc second.
- Small verified steps; commit each completed task; hand non-trivial changes to
  `reviewer`.
- Claim a lane and a build dir before editing (see `notes/lanes.md`).

## Environment

- Python `.venv/`; Ghidra 12.2 + MCP `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp`; w64devkit;
  SDL3 3.4.18.
- Build: `scripts/build.ps1 -BuildDir build/<lane>` (default `build/mingw`).
- Tests: `scripts/test.ps1 -Exe build/<lane>/dino_viewer.exe -Fast` or
  `scripts/run-tests.ps1` for the full suite.
- Retail play: `scripts/play-windowed-game.ps1` (`run-window/`, bordered
  800x600, starts behind your work; click inside to capture the mouse, click
  outside to release).
  x32dbg: `scripts/x32dbg/play-freegame.ps1` / `start-campaign.ps1`
  (`run-test/`, virtual input; screenshots background-safe, but retail stops
  polling DirectInput when inactive, so clicks need the game active).
  Harness screenshots go to `notes/harness/`; tracked `notes/*.png` are
  evidence, do not overwrite.
- UI click map: `docs/platform/ui-coordinates.md` + `.json`; query with
  `.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\formats\ui_map.py find <NAME>`.
- Verify everything: `scripts/verify.ps1` (`-Fast` for the quick loop).

## Lanes and owners

See `notes/lanes.md`. Default split:

- `src/hook`, `docs/decomp`, `notes/hybrid-*` — hybrid/hooks.
- `src/viewer`, `src/world`, `src/ui`, `src/formats`, `tests/test_viewer_cpp.py`
  — port/viewer.
- `tools/formats`, `docs/formats`, `tests/test_*.py` — formats.
- `notes/*`, `docs/decomp` — recon.
- `scripts/`, `run-test/`, `run-window/` — harness.

## Focus

- SAVE-2: **complete and accepted by retail.** The C++ writer re-serializes
  the whole `.sav` byte-identically; a `--sav-write` output (`cppwrite`) is
  listed by the retail LOAD GAME panel, selects and loads a park
  (`notes/sav-retail-accept.png`). `--sav-name/--sav-slot/--sav-budget`
  mutate header/park fields for testing. The saved camera tail is applied by
  `--sav-park` as a port convenience; retail **manual LOAD** ignores it
  (`notes/sav-camera-load-ignored.png`). Autosave flag confirmed: patching
  park `header_a` 3→0 and `header_c` 0→10 makes an autosave manually
  loadable (`notes/sav-autosave-manualized.png`); `tools/formats/sav_manual.py`
  does the patch, and `--sav-manual` is the C++ follow-up once `main.cpp`
  is free.
- SAVE-2 campaign class: `list0` is `saDinosaur` (`0x570c90`/`0x5706c0`);
  tail `0x2D1 + threshold + tex_bytes + 0x16*N` (N at `path+0x1c6`), no
  length prefix. `tools/formats/sav_campaign.py` models every field and
  re-encodes all 20 records byte-identically; the C++ writer validates each
  record length and keeps list0 + list1/tail raw, so `--sav-roundtrip`/
  `--sav-write` are byte-identical on the 53 KB sample (no test skip).
  list1/list2 decoded (2 food sources, 6 employees). Campaign saves have
  **no park block** (`FUN_0058b200` gates it out); remaining: 57-record
  attraction list, store/lab tail, typed C++ list0.
- SHOW-4: mission `[SHOWS]` catalog, `--place-show`, the 10-slot hourly
  `ShowRuntime`, the interactive construction panel (`PREDEFINED_SHOW_LIST`
  selection/scroll + VALIDATE placement) and the ten attraction rows
  (lock/iteration/permutation/selection) are ported; remaining: live `.bfi`
  arena/judge actors and per-show weight authoring.
- P3-CACHE: writers ported. GetCourage/ObstAttackSize1 completion sets
  `DinoNeeds::threat`/`threat_radius` from the exact
  `combined_attack`/`obstacle_radius`; DINOPSAV persists both caches and
  sources. The chooser's per-action target provider (`+0x14`) is ported
  (`ActionTarget` + `ActionThreatProvider`); `FUN_00569640`/`FUN_0056a9a0`
  attach one target per action list (owner skip at `+0x0c`; one-fill lag).
- P3-PERCEPTION: the visitor/obstacle reaction lists (`beh+0xf4`/`+0xb8`/
  `+0xc8`) have **no writer in this build** (whole-image store census), so the
  list-driven starters are inert. Target policy `+0x14` is ported; the live
  entry points are the direct `start_visitor`/`start_dino(slot, block,
  instance)` calls used by the show/attraction controller. A Cpg04 trace
  (`notes/target-vtable-runtime.md`) saw `0x521d80` fire 20 times with actor
  targets, `0x521d10` 0, and box only gated for `Eat`; Free Game has 0 dinos.
- P3 rest: element bone/event overlay source and the visitor/obstacle
  perception reaction; the cache writers are done.
- UI-2 Phase C rest: list snapshots, slider/checkbox selection, minimap
  water/partition polish.
- WORLD-3/2 polish: skybox bottom/side seam, frustum culling/LOD2.
- TOOL-4: **park load solved.** The background stall was a hidden mcLib
  "Unable to restore previous video mode" dialog: dgVoodoo returned
  `D3DERR_DEVICELOST` for the park's 800x600 R5G6B5 Reset. The proxy now
  forces 16-bit park Resets to X8R8G8B8 and activates the game window on the
  Reset thread; the free-game park loads and renders
  (`notes/park-retail-windowed.png`). `notes/park-load-static.md` has the
  call map; `notes/background-input-recon.md` §4b the resolution.

## Next actions

1. P3 perception: wire the direct `start_visitor`/`start_dino` entry points
   in the show/attraction controller (Cpg04 is the test park; Free Game has 0
   dinos). Do not invent a list producer; the lists stay empty.
2. CAMPAIGN population: `WldWorld.records` now retains campaign shows/
   animals/employees; wire them into `load_campaign_park` and assert
   shows=1/animals=2/employees=6 on Cpg04 (`notes/playtest-2026-10-27.md`).
3. SHOW-4 rest: live `.bfi` arena/judge actors and per-show weight
   authoring; the construction panel and attraction-list actions are in.
4. SAVE-2 HUD: cash is `economy+0x08` = park `+0x30`. Manual/autosave `.sav`
   LOAD has `BL=0` and restores it; the `0x58b1b0` skip is only the campaign
   `.wld` path (`BL=1`, no park block). The port matches; the 26000 mystery
   needs a runtime watch (`notes/hud-budget-restore-flag-recon.md` §8).
4. WORLD-3: fix the skybox bottom/side seam and capture the final side-by-side.
